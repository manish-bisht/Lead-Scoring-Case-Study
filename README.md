# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. 
The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and 
the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

Business Goal is to Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. 
A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
